# simple-graphs
Simple time visualisations using Google chart API and JSON

To create simple visualisation named example:
* Create example.js with the visualisation options (e.g., copy and rename translators.js and replace the visualisation name inside the file)
* Create example.json with the data you want to represent (more info on format at https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference?csw=1#DataTable )
* Edit index.html to add the example.script and an #example element where you want to represent the graph.
* Push it to your git repo, and publish it as web content with **git push -f origin master:gh-pages**
